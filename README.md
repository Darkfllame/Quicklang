# Quicklang
This is a trash language that I wanted to make long ago
## Features
For now approximatively nothing, only the lexer, if you're interested go to the [lexer](src/Lexer.zig)
## Example
I made an example and a testing file for my programming language, which is [test.qk](test.qk)

### Remind
Keep in mind that this project is maintaned by only one person (me) and thus won't cover every edge cases, if you want to contribute, go ahead, i'm open for help
